Where does the browser "enter" my code?
Where does the server "return back" to the browser?
  The server returns back to the brower after it has finished running the ruby code in Sinatra, and renders a view erb.
When do views get rendered?
  Once the view erb is called, server sends HTML data to the brower, which in turn renders it for the user to view.
